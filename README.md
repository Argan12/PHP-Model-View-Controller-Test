# PHP Model View Controller Website

I've coded this Website in October 2018.

It's a sort of social network : you have to create an account and this social network permit you to publish some posts and to comment them. You can also modify your posts or delete them.

I've made this Website for learning MVC architecture.

## Languages used :
* HTML 5, CSS3
* JavaScript
* PHP, MySQL
